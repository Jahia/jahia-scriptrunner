- Improve JackrabbitHelper to remove a lot of hardcoded configuration (for example FileSystem instances) and replace
them with values coming from the real Jackrabbit configuration. Same thing could also be done for the parameters to
initialize the persistencemanagers but that is a bit more complex since we would have to integrate some kind of bean
utility to call the setters.
- Currently it only works with FileDataStore, not with DbDataStore
